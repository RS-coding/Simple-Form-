This is an exercise of JavaScript Course 

Hi guys! I am new here! This is my fisrt test on GitHUB. 
I am starting the adventurour of Frontend Web Development. I wish I could say know that I am a Frontend Developer but still I have a lot to learn such as JavaScript and frameworks like Vue and React. ThatÂ´s why I dicided to join this community to start the really hard work and develop my skills. 
So this is a super simple exercise( I know ) but is the start. You can always push me to the front to give me some tips and tell me how to improve and do better! Hope you enjoy it!
